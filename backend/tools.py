"""
Tool schemas exposed to Gemini during the call.

IMPORTANT (per architecture discussion): these tools express INTENT,
not final outcomes. Gemini calling book_meeting(...) means "the model
thinks the caller wants to book a meeting" — it's the
ConversationManager (conversation_manager.py) that decides whether
that's actually valid and finalizes the outcome. Keep the handler
logic in ConversationManager, not here — this file only declares the
shape of each tool for the LLM.
